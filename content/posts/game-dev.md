## Introduction

Phaser.js is a powerful, open-source JavaScript Framework for creating 2D Games that run in your web browser. In this guide, I'll walk you through the essential steps to build a simple game from scratch. 

No prior game-development experience is required - although, just basic JavaScript knowledge and a text editor would be well preferred :)

## What You'll Learn

- Setting up your Development Environment  
- Creating a basic Phaser Project  
- Loading Assets (images, audio, etc.)  
- Displaying Sprites and Animations  
- Handling User Input  
- Adding Simple Physics and Collisions  
- Packaging and Deploying your Game

## 1. Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Install Node.js and npm**  
   Phaser Projects typically use npm for Package Management. Download and Install Node.js (which includes npm) from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

2. **Create a Project Folder**  
   ```bash
   mkdir my-phaser-game
   cd my-phaser-game
````
````
3. **Initialize npm and Install Phaser**

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   npm install phaser
   ```

4. **Add a Development Server**
   To test your game in the browser, install a simple server:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev live-server
   ```

   Add a script in your `package.json`:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "live-server --port=8080"
   }
   ```

## 2. Creating Your First Scene

Phaser Organizes your Game into **Scenes**. Each scene handles its own Loading, Setup, and Update Loop.

1. **Create an `index.html`**

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8" />
     <title>My Phaser Game</title>
   </head>
   <body>
     <script src="node_modules/phaser/dist/phaser.js"></script>
     <script src="src/main.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. **Create `src/main.js`**

   ```js
   import Phaser from 'phaser';

   const config = {
     type: Phaser.AUTO,
     width: 800,
     height: 600,
     scene: {
       preload,
       create,
       update
     }
   };

   const game = new Phaser.Game(config);

   function preload() {
     this.load.image('sky', 'assets/sky.png');
   }

   function create() {
     this.add.image(400, 300, 'sky');
   }

   function update() {
     // tumhara jo bhi game logic hai, woh idhar jayega.
   }
   ```

3. **Run Your Game**

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser—you should see your “sky” background!

## 3. Loading and Displaying Assets

* **Images/Spritesheets**

  ```js
  this.load.spritesheet('player', 'assets/player.png', {
    frameWidth: 32,
    frameHeight: 48
  });
  ```

* **Audio**

  ```js
  this.load.audio('jump', 'assets/jump.wav');
  ```

---

## 4. Adding Animations

Define animations in `create()`:

```js
this.anims.create({
  key: 'walk',
  frames: this.anims.generateFrameNumbers('player', { start: 0, end: 3 }),
  frameRate: 10,
  repeat: -1
});
```

Play animation on a sprite:

```js
const player = this.add.sprite(100, 450, 'player');
player.anims.play('walk');
```

---

## 5. Handling User Input

Use Phaser’s built‑in input manager:

```js
const cursors = this.input.keyboard.createCursorKeys();

function update() {
  if (cursors.left.isDown) {
    player.x -= 2;
    player.anims.play('walk', true);
  } else if (cursors.right.isDown) {
    player.x += 2;
    player.anims.play('walk', true);
  } else {
    player.anims.stop();
  }
}
```

---

## 6. Physics and Collisions

Phaser includes Arcade Physics by Default:

1. **Enable Physics**

   ```js
   const player = this.physics.add.sprite(100, 450, 'player');
   player.setBounce(0.2);
   player.setCollideWorldBounds(true);
   ```

2. **Create Platforms**

   ```js
   const platforms = this.physics.add.staticGroup();
   platforms.create(400, 568, 'ground').setScale(2).refreshBody();
   ```

3. **Add Collision Detection**

   ```js
   this.physics.add.collider(player, platforms);
   ```

---

## 7. Packaging and Deployment

1. **Build Your Game**
   Phaser Games are just Static Files. Meaning you can bundle them with tools like Webpack or Rollup, or simply copy your `index.html`, `src/`, and `assets/` folders.

2. **Host on GitHub Pages**

   * Push your project to GitHub
   * In Repository Settings → Pages → select `main` branch and `/root`
   * Your Game is Live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`

3. **Other Options**

   * Netlify
   * Vercel (most preferred according to me)
   * Firebase Hosting

## Conclusion

You’ve now set up a basic Phaser.js Project, Loaded Assets, Created Animations, Handled Input, and Added Simple Physics. From here, explore more Phaser features like— Tilemaps, Particle Effects, Shaders—and build the game of your dreams!
Have Fun Developing Games!
