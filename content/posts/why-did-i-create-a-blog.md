## Short Story About Me

Welcome to My Blog! I think for the first blog post in my life it would be nice to introduce myself however I'm a shy person but I'll still have to :)

I'm Aayush, a guy who lives in Mumbai (Originally from UP) who has been programming for 2 years, I'm a self-taught passionate programmer and an avid space-enthusiast. Last 1.5 years, I worked on freelance as a frontend developer, eventually I used to create only simple projects where you only need to know a little bit of JS, HTML, CSS.

It seems to me that I have stucked as a developer for 1.5 years and now I decided to curb web development with the best technologies, tools, and libraries.

## Why am I Blogging?

There are several reasons to start blogging like:

- I hope my articles will be useful for some people, I will work hard to make my articles useful.
- Through this blog, I hope to inspire others by sharing my journey and help them find their own unique voice.
- I wanted to use these stories as a way of expressing myself.
- Writing a blog will allow me to explore different web development technologies (frameworks, libraries, tools) thus I will enhance my development skills.
- Probably it can help to get a job or work in a team with great ideas :)

## What I'm Going to Blog About

I know that the internet is filled with unlimited resources, and blogs already. Starting a blog is like a marathon not a sprint thus I won't give up even if I don't succeed :)

I hope my posts will stand out, mainly I'm going to blog about my journey, space, technology, geopolitics, and many more stuffs that I know and I don't.
