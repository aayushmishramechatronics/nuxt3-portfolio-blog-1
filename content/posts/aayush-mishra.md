## Short Introduction  

Hi, I'm Aayush. I'm someone that loves to explore and learn new stuff, probably every single day. Nonetheless, I'm still an average Indian teenager who just happens to have some weird yet common interests like - Aeronautics, Maths, Astrophysics/Astronomy and many more! Over the years, I grew up to be more introverted and be a boy who'd always enjoy his own little world - a place where he felt comfortable because it was just him. This blog explores my upbringing and what shaped me into who I am today.

## Upbringing - the Tales of Early 2010's

# 2005 - 2008
Life, initially was pretty difficult for me and my family. We weren't financially stable and my parents struggled to save money, my mom still recalls some moments  where they didn't have enough money to even buy me clothes. I never complained to my parents for the things that they couldn't get me, because I saw how hard it is to earn and provide for a family of 4 and run the household whilst saving whatever amount of money would be left. Initial 3 years of my life were difficult, we all struggled together - but as they say, where there's will there's always a way. Dad got an opportunity to work in abroad and he moved out, and just a year later he bought me, my sister and my mom to abroad. 

## The Tales of Middle East 

# UAE, Sharjah - 2008
we all were very very new to this strange yet modern country, UAE. Back in 2008-09, Dubai was still a country under heavy development and there was construction happening almost everywhere - we stayed in Sharjah, a place close to the capital. There were many Indian family just like ours, many of them were Malayalis and Gujaratis - all co-existed peacefully and they welcomed us with open arms. I was old enough to be thrown into a School, lmao but I always had my sister besides me. Though I hate her even now (not really), but she was always there for me when I found myself overwhelmed with all these people around me. I never got well in with my surrounding, over time I just mixed in with them someway and I don't even know how. We lived in Sharjah for 3 years up until 2011, and then my dad got another job in a different country - Oman. 

# Oman, Muscat - 2011
we packed our bags with a tad-bit of hope and a lot of aspirations. I lived some of my best life there, almost 10 years we stayed in a country which later we would call as our 'second home'. We were financially constrained - even during this time, hence we almost never spent money on travelling or buying expensive clothes or gifts. Despite this, my parents gave me the best life I could've ever asked them for. They sacrificed a lot, and I do mean a lot. My sister and I eventually understood the value of this 'money' - capitalism has to suck isn't it :) 

children around me were as ordinary as me, but they were quite rich - they wore better clothes, had expensive stationaries and school accessories. I had what my dear parents could provide, and I never complained to them (yeah I was a very demanding kid back then, but I only demanded for more toys - lmfao). We braved through some tough times - had extremely supportive neighbourhood and it was like as if they were our own. I did have friends, not many and even after being in college, I don't have many friends. I never kept many of them, why? because I was very introverted - many would end up never talking after a year and I was completely fine with it somehow. I can count my friends on my fingers, very few but some of the best people I've met. We played together, day and night (during holidays ofcourse) and grew up together - attending each other's birthday parties every year. And even now, I hope they're doing well in their life - time flies by really fast doesn't it :)

and after happily living for almost 10 years, it was time for us to say goodbye to Muscat - Ruwi. The area where I spent almost all my childhood, when I last visited (back in 2021) the small store uncle still remembered me, the caretaker of our apartment welcomed us with open arms - like they always did. I sometimes wish if we could live the same life over and over again, sure there might be challenges and difficulties - but without them there's no fun in life, at least this is what I believe.
